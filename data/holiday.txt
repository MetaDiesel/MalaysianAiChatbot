Thanu: [looking out the window] Wah, so many trees lah. Nice juga this view. Macam very calming, kan?

Surheern: Calming? What you talking about lah, Thanu? You sound like those Insta captions, "Nature heals the soul." You okay ke, bro? Got breakup I don’t know about?

Thanu: [blushing] Eh, don’t simply say things lah! Just appreciating the view, okay? Not everything has to be drama.

Surheern: [grinning mischievously] Wah, suddenly philosopher, ah? Next time, you sit beside me and caption my life, "Surheern eating keropok like a true kampung boy."

Thanu: [trying not to laugh] Eh, at least I say something meaningful lah. You? All you do is kacau people.

Surheern: [mock serious] Kacau? Eh, don’t say I kacau! I make life more interesting, you know? If not for me, you’d be sitting here diam-diam looking at trees only. Boring lah, bro.

Thanu: [laughing softly] Ya lah, ya lah. Okay, you “life of the party,” happy now?

Surheern: [grinning and leaning back] Finally, you admit. Don’t worry, Thanu. Your abang Surheern will make sure this trip is legendary. You’ll go back and tell people, "Pulau Perhentian? I had the time of my life because of my super-cool cousin."

Thanu: [rolling eyes] Cool konon. You’re only cool when you keep quiet, you know.

Surheern: [pretending to be offended] Wah, hati keras! Okay lah, Thanu, since you so pandai, what’s your plan for the island? You want to take selfies with fish, is it? "Fish therapy heals the soul" pula nanti.

Thanu: [laughing while shaking head] I just want to enjoy the beach lah. Sit down, chill, maybe read a book. Not everyone needs to buat drama 24/7 like you.

Surheern: [mock gasping] Wah, read a book? Bro, this is holiday lah, bukan library! You want to read, you stay in KL, save money. I’ll go find the turtles myself.

Thanu: [smiling] At least turtles don’t talk too much like you. Peaceful only.

Surheern: [leaning closer with a sly grin] Eh, turtles talk to me, okay? I got special connection. They’ll be like, “Surheern, you’re the coolest human we’ve seen.” Then I’ll bring one back for you as a pet. Can name it “Silent Thanu.”

Thanu: [laughing and lightly smacking Surheern’s arm] You nonsense lah! Already making fake stories before even reaching the island.

Surheern: [shrugging dramatically] What to do, lah? I’m creative. If not for me, this car ride so dull. Later, when we reach, you’ll see lah. I’ll make friends with the whole island. You just sit there with your book.

Thanu: [shaking head but smiling] You memang banyak mulut lah, Surheern. But okay, you win. You make the trip fun. Happy?

Surheern: [pretending to wipe a tear] Wah, this is the moment I’ve been waiting for. Thanu finally admits I’m the fun one. Okay lah, I’ll go easy on you for the rest of the trip. Maybe.

Thanu: [laughing again] Jangan kacau too much, okay? Just enjoy the trip without making too many scenes.

Surheern: Scenes? I am the scene lah, Thanu. Pulau Perhentian tak ready for me.




Pulau Perhentian is an idyllic escape, but the adventure begins long before you set foot on its white sandy beaches. The journey to Kuala Besut Jetty, the gateway to the Perhentian Islands, is an essential part of the holiday experience. Driving from the city offers a golden opportunity for family bonding, laughter, and shared excitement.

Imagine this: it’s a sunny morning, and your family piles into the car with snacks, drinks, and a playlist of everyone’s favorite songs. Surheern, sitting in the back seat, clutches a bag of chips, already munching while grinning ear to ear. Thanu, on the other hand, is excitedly flipping through a travel guide about Pulau Perhentian, pointing out activities they want to try. The road ahead is long but filled with promise. The highways are smooth and scenic, with stops planned along the way to stretch your legs and explore. Your first break might be at a quaint roadside stall selling hot nasi lemak wrapped in banana leaves. Surheern’s eyes light up as the fragrant aroma fills the air, and they eagerly unwrap the packet, exclaiming, "This is so good, I could eat three of these!" Thanu nods in agreement, their mouth already full of rice and sambal.

As you drive closer to Terengganu, the scenery transforms into lush greenery and glimpses of traditional Malay villages. Kids in the back seat are playing classic car games like “I Spy,” with Surheern gleefully shouting, “I spy something green!” every few minutes, giggling at the predictability of their answer. Thanu, ever the competitor, raises the stakes with tricky challenges that get everyone laughing. A detour to Bukit Keluang could add an impromptu hike to the trip, with sweeping views of the sea from the hilltop. The excitement on Surheern and Thanu’s faces as they race each other up the trail is infectious, and their cheers when they reach the top make the effort worth it. The family snaps group photos, with Surheern pretending to push Thanu toward the edge of the viewpoint, both of them laughing uncontrollably.

Reaching Kuala Besut Jetty is a moment of palpable excitement. Everyone’s energy spikes as you board the ferry, with the wind in your hair and the salty sea spray on your face. Thanu leans over the railing, eyes wide, pointing out fish darting below and shouting, “Look, look, there’s one right there!” Meanwhile, Surheern can’t stop grinning, shouting over the engine noise, “This is the best boat ride ever!” By the time you arrive at Pulau Perhentian, the journey has already set the tone for an unforgettable trip.

On the island, the fun multiplies. Your family checks into a cozy beachfront chalet, greeted by the rhythmic sound of waves crashing against the shore. Surheern immediately throws their backpack onto the nearest bed and runs out to the balcony, yelling, “We can see the beach from here!” The first order of business is to hit the beach. Thanu sprints into the clear, shallow water, squealing with delight as schools of colorful fish dart around their feet, while Surheern enthusiastically splashes everyone within reach. Parents relax under the shade of coconut trees, sipping fresh coconuts as they watch the kids play, the peaceful atmosphere broken only by the sound of laughter.

One of the highlights is a snorkeling trip, which feels like diving into a natural aquarium. The entire family marvels at the vibrant coral reefs and marine life, spotting everything from clownfish to sea turtles. Thanu, captivated by the underwater world, surfaces to shout, “I just saw a turtle! A real turtle!” Surheern, ever the joker, pretends to be a fish, making exaggerated swimming motions that leave everyone laughing so hard they nearly drop their snorkels. For the more adventurous, there’s the option of scuba diving or kayaking around the island. Evenings are magical, with barbecues by the beach. Surheern helps grill the seafood, claiming to have “the best seasoning hands in the family,” while Thanu plates the dishes, sneaking extra prawns onto their plate.

For quieter moments, jungle treks are an excellent way to explore the island’s interior. The trails lead to secluded beaches and breathtaking viewpoints. Along the way, the family encounters monkeys swinging from branches, which makes Surheern squeal in mock fear while clinging dramatically to Thanu, who bravely declares, “I’ll protect you!” If your family enjoys photography, the island’s dramatic sunsets and lush landscapes offer endless opportunities for stunning family portraits. Thanu becomes the self-declared family photographer, insisting on the perfect angles, while Surheern photobombs every shot, much to everyone’s amusement.

The best part about Pulau Perhentian is its simplicity. There are no large commercial complexes or high-rises to distract from nature’s beauty. It’s just you, your family, and the island’s charm. This slower pace allows everyone to truly connect, whether it’s playing cards on the porch of your chalet, where Surheern keeps “accidentally” dropping their cards, or sharing a quiet moment watching the sunrise together as Thanu hums a tune softly in the background.

Ultimately, the magic of Pulau Perhentian lies not just in its breathtaking beaches but in the journey itself. The road trip, ferry ride, and shared excitement of exploring the island make it a perfect family destination. The laughter, playful banter, and shared awe on the faces of Surheern and Thanu turn this trip into more than a vacation—it becomes a cherished memory etched in everyone’s hearts forever.



Pulau Tioman, a tropical haven nestled off the coast of Pahang, is not just a destination—it’s an experience that begins the moment you leave home. The drive to Mersing Jetty, the gateway to this enchanting island, is a journey full of anticipation, bonding, and shared joy.

It all starts with the family loading up the car, bags packed with swimsuits, snacks, and an unmistakable sense of excitement. Thanu, armed with a map of Malaysia, proudly announces themselves as the navigator, declaring, “We’re taking the scenic route!” Surheern, meanwhile, is already sprawled in the backseat, munching on chips and curating the perfect road trip playlist. The first stretch of the drive is filled with the sound of laughter, music, and playful debates over which snacks to open next.

As the cityscape gives way to open highways, the scenery becomes a rolling canvas of green hills, palm plantations, and charming kampungs (villages). Every so often, the family stops to stretch their legs, whether it’s at a bustling R&R station for a quick bite of roti canai or at a roadside fruit stall where Surheern excitedly chooses the juiciest mangoes. Thanu, ever the adventurer, spots a rustic wooden bridge and insists on stopping for a quick photo op, much to everyone’s delight. Back in the car, the kids entertain themselves with endless rounds of “20 Questions,” and when Surheern stumps everyone with a clue about “something salty,” the entire car erupts in laughter at the eventual reveal: the sea they’re driving toward.

Approaching Mersing Jetty is a crescendo of excitement. The coastal breeze and sight of fishing boats bobbing in the harbor build the anticipation. Boarding the ferry, Surheern can’t stop marveling at the water’s changing hues, pointing out every wave crest with a shout of, “Look, it’s so blue!” Thanu, on the other hand, is busy snapping selfies against the backdrop of the sea, declaring, “This is going straight to my story!” As the ferry slices through the water, the family bonds over the thrill of spotting distant islands on the horizon.

When the ferry docks at Pulau Tioman, it feels like stepping into a dream. The family is greeted by crystal-clear waters and golden sands, with their chalet just a stone’s throw from the beach. Thanu wastes no time kicking off their shoes and dashing into the water, calling back, “Come on, it’s perfect!” Surheern, ever the prankster, trails behind, splashing water at everyone in arm’s reach. Parents relax on the shoreline, sipping fresh coconuts as they watch their children’s antics unfold against the backdrop of swaying palms.

The island offers endless activities, each more thrilling than the last. A snorkeling trip becomes a family highlight as they explore Coral Island, where the underwater world bursts into life. Thanu, enchanted by the vibrant corals, pops up from the water, shouting, “It’s like swimming in a rainbow!” Surheern, true to form, pretends to be a mermaid, dramatically flipping their “tail” and making everyone laugh so hard they nearly drop their snorkels. For those seeking adventure, the island’s jungle trails are a must. The family embarks on a trek to the Asah Waterfall, with Surheern keeping spirits high by mimicking the calls of the birds they hear along the way. When they finally reach the cascading waters, Thanu dives right in, splashing and laughing, “I found the best spot!”

Evenings on Tioman are equally magical. The family gathers for a barbecue by the beach, grilling fresh seafood while the sun dips below the horizon in a blaze of orange and pink. Surheern takes over the grill, dramatically flipping prawns while announcing, “Master Chef at work!” Thanu, meanwhile, organizes a makeshift beachside karaoke session, leading everyone in a rousing chorus of their favorite songs. Later, as the stars blanket the sky, the family lies on the sand, spotting constellations while Surheern attempts to name every single star, making up hilarious names along the way.

On quieter days, the family takes a glass-bottom boat ride to marvel at the marine life without getting wet, much to Thanu’s delight. Surheern, on the other hand, convinces everyone to rent bicycles to explore the nearby villages. Pedaling through Tioman’s charming lanes, they stop to chat with locals, sample kuih-muih (traditional cakes), and pick up handmade souvenirs. Thanu finds a beautifully carved wooden keychain and declares, “This is going on my bag forever!”

Tioman’s blend of tranquility and adventure makes it a perfect family destination. There’s no rush, no stress—just time to connect and create memories. Whether it’s playing cards on the chalet porch, where Surheern pretends to cheat with dramatic flair, or waking up early to catch the sunrise at the jetty, where Thanu whispers, “This is the best morning ever,” the island offers moments that feel timeless.

The road trip, ferry ride, and days spent exploring Tioman become more than just a holiday—they become a story the family will retell for years. For Surheern and Thanu, the island is more than a place; it’s an adventure filled with laughter, discoveries, and a bond that grows stronger with every shared moment.


Pulau Redang, a gem off the coast of Terengganu, is a destination that promises not just stunning beaches and azure waters but also a journey filled with joy, laughter, and family bonding. The adventure begins as soon as the car is packed, with bags full of swimsuits, snacks, and endless excitement.

Picture this: it’s an early morning, and the family piles into the car, ready for the road trip to Merang Jetty. Surheern insists on claiming the best seat by the window, holding a travel pillow and a stash of snacks. Thanu, ever the navigator, takes the front seat, armed with Google Maps and a determination to “find the fastest route.” The drive starts with upbeat music, a playlist carefully curated by Thanu, featuring everyone’s favorite tunes. Surheern keeps adding commentary to the songs, turning every lyric into a joke that has the whole car roaring with laughter.

As the highway gives way to scenic countryside roads, the family decides to make a stop at a roadside stall for breakfast. The sight of steaming nasi kerabu and warm teh tarik excites everyone. Surheern, with wide eyes, declares, “This is the best road trip meal ever!” Thanu eagerly tries the blue rice, exclaiming, “I’m going to remember this taste forever!” After breakfast, the journey continues, with the kids keeping themselves entertained by spotting kampungs and playing “Who Can Spot the Sea First?” Every now and then, they burst into fits of laughter as Surheern makes dramatic guesses like, “I see it... no wait, that’s just a puddle!”

A detour to Sekayu Waterfall adds a touch of adventure to the drive. The family decides to stretch their legs and enjoy the cool, cascading water. Thanu is the first to dip their feet in, shouting, “This is amazing!” while Surheern, always the prankster, splashes water at everyone, triggering a mini water fight. The brief stop becomes a highlight of the journey, with everyone soaking up the beauty of nature before continuing toward Merang.

Reaching the jetty, the anticipation in the air is electric. The family boards the ferry, with Thanu eagerly leaning over the railings, pointing out every boat and wave, while Surheern waves dramatically at other passengers as if they were on a royal cruise. The ferry ride feels like an adventure itself, with the cool sea breeze and the sparkling water stretching endlessly ahead.

When the ferry finally docks at Pulau Redang, it’s as if they’ve stepped into a dream. The family is greeted by powdery white sands and water so clear that fish are visible from the shore. Thanu wastes no time rushing into the water, shouting, “This is exactly like the pictures!” Surheern follows suit, pretending to dive dramatically while yelling, “Look at me, I’m a dolphin!” The parents settle onto beach chairs under a shady tree, watching the kids with a mix of amusement and joy.

The days on Redang are filled with unforgettable moments. The highlight for everyone is snorkeling at the Marine Park, where the underwater world comes alive with vibrant corals and fish. Thanu, mesmerized by a school of parrotfish, surfaces to shout, “It’s like being in an aquarium, but better!” Meanwhile, Surheern stays true to their jokester persona, pointing at a sea cucumber and declaring, “I found the most delicious sushi!” much to everyone’s laughter. The family also takes a boat ride around the island, marveling at hidden coves and secret beaches, with Thanu documenting everything on their phone, determined to make a travel vlog.

Evenings on Redang are magical. The family gathers for dinner at a beachfront restaurant, where freshly grilled seafood and tropical fruit juices steal the show. Surheern tries to balance a shrimp on their fork while joking, “I’m auditioning for a food blog!” Thanu, always the foodie, tastes everything and declares, “We need to recreate this at home!” After dinner, the family takes a quiet stroll along the beach under a sky full of stars, with Thanu pointing out constellations and Surheern pretending to see UFOs.

For quieter moments, the family explores the island’s interior through easy jungle treks. Along the way, they encounter curious monkeys and colorful birds, which delights Thanu, who says, “This is like walking through a nature documentary!” Surheern picks up a large stick, pretending to be an explorer, and announces, “I’m leading us to treasure!” Their antics turn every step into a laugh-filled adventure.

Back at the resort, the family enjoys simple pleasures like playing cards on the porch, where Surheern insists on creating “house rules” that always seem to favor them. Thanu spends time capturing the perfect sunset photos, saying, “This is going to be my phone wallpaper forever!” The slower pace of the island lets everyone relax and connect, whether it’s watching the sunrise together or sharing quiet conversations about the best moments of the trip.

Pulau Redang offers the perfect mix of fun, relaxation, and natural beauty. The road trip to Merang, filled with jokes, games, and delicious food, becomes an integral part of the holiday. The ferry ride adds a layer of excitement, and the days spent on the island create memories that feel almost too perfect to be real. For Surheern and Thanu, every moment—whether it’s splashing in the water, trekking through the jungle, or simply laughing together—cements this trip as one of the best family adventures they’ve ever had.


Pulau Rawa, a hidden gem off the coast of Johor, offers a serene and intimate getaway for families looking to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life. However, the magic of this trip begins long before you step onto its soft sandy shores. The drive to Mersing Jetty, the gateway to Rawa, is where the adventure truly kicks off, filled with laughter, excitement, and unforgettable family moments.

The journey starts early in the morning, with everyone brimming with excitement. Surheern, clutching their favorite neck pillow, is already rummaging through the snack bag, asking, “When can I open the cookies?” Thanu, ever the organizer, has the playlist ready to go, ensuring the first song sets the tone for an epic road trip. As the car rolls out of the driveway, the family is greeted by the promise of open roads, beautiful scenery, and quality time together.

The drive from the city to Mersing takes you through scenic routes lined with palm plantations and charming kampungs (villages). Along the way, the family makes plenty of fun stops. At one roadside stall, they enjoy steaming bowls of laksa and sip on refreshing coconut water. Surheern enthusiastically slurps their noodles, declaring, “This is better than any restaurant!” Meanwhile, Thanu wanders over to a stall selling colorful woven baskets and insists on buying one for the trip, saying, “This will be perfect for carrying shells from the beach!”

As the car winds closer to Mersing, the excitement builds. The family makes a detour to explore Tanjung Leman beach, taking a short break to stretch their legs and enjoy the sea breeze. Thanu picks up smooth pebbles from the shore, attempting to skip them across the water, while Surheern dramatically practices their “pirate stance” on a washed-up log, shouting, “Arrr, mateys! I’m ready for Rawa!” The laughter echoes through the group, making even this brief stop a cherished memory.

Arriving at Mersing Jetty, the sight of the ocean and the busy harbor electrifies everyone. Boarding the boat to Rawa is a moment of pure anticipation. Thanu can barely contain their excitement, leaning over the edge of the boat to spot fish darting in the water below, while Surheern entertains everyone by pretending to steer the boat, yelling, “Captain Surheern at your service!” The ride itself is exhilarating, with the wind whipping through everyone’s hair and the promise of adventure just ahead.

When the boat pulls up to Pulau Rawa, it feels like a scene out of a postcard. The island is small and secluded, with pristine beaches and waters so clear you can see the fish swimming near the shore. Surheern lets out a loud “Whoa!” before leaping off the boat with an exaggerated pose, pretending to “land like a superhero.” Thanu is right behind, eagerly pointing at the waterslide that leads straight into the sea, exclaiming, “We have to do that first!”

The island is a haven for families, offering both relaxation and fun-filled activities. The kids immediately make a beeline for the waterslide, taking turns racing each other into the warm turquoise sea. Thanu’s face lights up as they splash into the water, shouting, “This is the best slide ever!” Surheern, of course, takes every chance to show off with dramatic dives, pretending to be a stunt double. Parents watch from the shore, soaking up the sun and enjoying the serene atmosphere while the kids burn off their endless energy.

Snorkeling around Rawa is a highlight for everyone. The reefs are teeming with colorful marine life, and Thanu is mesmerized by the vibrant corals, surfacing to shout, “I just saw a clownfish—it’s like Nemo!” Surheern, always the comedian, pretends to be a fish, mimicking their movements and making everyone laugh so hard they almost forget to snorkel. The island also offers paddleboarding and kayaking, which turn into playful races between the family. Thanu and Surheern pair up for a double kayak and end up splashing more water on each other than paddling forward, their giggles echoing across the water.

Evenings on Pulau Rawa are magical. The family gathers for a barbecue dinner on the beach, where the aroma of freshly grilled seafood fills the air. Surheern takes over the grill, dramatically flipping prawns while announcing, “Chef Surheern’s seafood special, coming right up!” Thanu helps set the table, carefully arranging everything and snapping photos, saying, “We need to remember this forever!” After dinner, the family sits around a bonfire, toasting marshmallows under a blanket of stars. Thanu tries to tell ghost stories but keeps laughing halfway through, while Surheern adds sound effects that make everyone burst into fits of laughter.

For quieter moments, the family explores the island’s walking trails. These short but scenic paths lead to stunning viewpoints overlooking the sea. Thanu insists on taking a photo at every turn, saying, “We need a picture for each moment!” Surheern, meanwhile, finds a large branch and pretends to be an adventurer leading the way, declaring, “Follow me, brave explorers!” The views from the top are breathtaking, and the family takes a moment to soak in the beauty, silently appreciating the bond they share.

Pulau Rawa’s charm lies in its simplicity and intimacy. Without the distractions of large crowds or commercial activities, the family has the chance to truly connect and enjoy each other’s company. The journey itself—filled with road trip games, shared snacks, and the thrill of the boat ride—makes the holiday feel like an adventure from start to finish. For Surheern and Thanu, every moment on Rawa, from sliding into the sea to watching the stars, becomes a treasure trove of memories they’ll carry forever.



Bali, the famed island paradise of Indonesia, promises golden beaches, vibrant culture, and endless activities—but for Surheern, the journey and crowds cast a shadow over what should have been an idyllic family getaway. Unlike road trips to Malaysia’s islands, the adventure to Bali begins at the airport, which lacks the shared laughter and spontaneity of a car ride.

The day starts with everyone lugging suitcases into a taxi for the trip to the airport. Thanu is excited, clutching their passport and chatting about all the temples and beaches they’ve read about. Surheern, on the other hand, is already grumbling about the early wake-up call and how they would have preferred a road trip. The airport itself, while organized, doesn’t help lift Surheern’s mood. The long security lines, crowded waiting areas, and delays leave them sulking in a corner with headphones on, muttering, “This is not how holidays are supposed to start.”

The flight is far from an improvement. Although Thanu marvels at the clouds and takes photos from the window seat, Surheern is unimpressed. The cramped airplane seat, the endless wait for the meal service, and the turbulence all add to their frustration. “Why do people love flying? It’s like being stuck in a tin can!” they exclaim, making the parents exchange knowing smiles but not daring to comment. By the time the family lands in Bali, the excitement from everyone else only emphasizes Surheern’s grumpiness, who mutters, “Finally,” as they shuffle off the plane.

At first glance, Bali seems to live up to its reputation. The drive from the airport offers glimpses of lush rice terraces, vibrant markets, and ornate temples. Thanu is in awe, snapping photos of every passing scene and excitedly pointing out places they want to visit. Surheern, however, quickly notices the traffic. “Why are there so many cars? This is worse than the city!” they groan, watching motorbikes weave in and out of the congestion. The crowded roads and honking horns make the journey to the hotel feel more stressful than exciting.

Once at the beach, things don’t improve for Surheern. While Thanu runs gleefully toward the waves, exclaiming, “This is exactly what I imagined!” Surheern stands back, arms crossed, scanning the packed shoreline. “Where’s the paradise? This looks like a festival I didn’t sign up for,” they mutter. The crowded beaches mean there’s barely any space to sit, and the noise of other tourists takes away the tranquility the family hoped for. Surheern tries to make the best of it by joining in a game of frisbee, but even that gets interrupted by someone accidentally walking through their play area. “This place needs a traffic light,” they joke sarcastically, rolling their eyes.

A visit to a famous temple like Tanah Lot also becomes a test of patience for Surheern. The family arrives to find throngs of tourists jostling for the perfect photo. Thanu doesn’t mind, weaving through the crowd and snapping selfies, but Surheern sighs dramatically, saying, “Are we here to see the temple or the backs of people’s heads?” Even the serene sunset views are marred by the endless clicking of cameras and chatter from the crowd. “This isn’t peaceful at all,” Surheern grumbles, retreating to a quieter corner.

Meals, while delicious, also come with challenges. Restaurants are often bustling, and waiting for a table adds to Surheern’s frustration. When the food finally arrives, they admit it’s tasty—“This satay is pretty good, I guess”—but the long wait overshadows the experience. Thanu, however, is delighted, eagerly trying everything on the menu and chatting with the staff about the local ingredients.

Despite the crowds, the family does find some quieter moments. A trek through the rice terraces offers a brief respite from the chaos. Thanu marvels at the vibrant green fields, while Surheern admits, “Okay, this is actually nice,” as they trail behind, snapping a few photos of their own. But the peace is short-lived, as the terraces are soon filled with other tourists. “There it is again, the endless crowd,” Surheern mutters under their breath, clearly longing for the quieter beaches of Malaysia.

The trip ends with a mixed bag of feelings. While Thanu is ecstatic, declaring, “Bali was amazing! I loved everything!” Surheern can’t hide their disappointment. “It’s not bad, but it’s too crowded. I don’t get the hype,” they say as the family boards the flight home. Even the return journey is met with sighs and complaints about the cramped seats and lack of legroom.

In the end, Bali’s beauty and cultural richness were overshadowed by the crowds and the less-than-enjoyable flight journey for Surheern. While Thanu treasures every moment, from the beaches to the food, Surheern can’t help but wish they had chosen a Malaysian island instead. “Next time, let’s drive to Redang or Perhentian,” they suggest on the way back, looking forward to a holiday that feels more intimate, more peaceful, and far less crowded.


Lombok, Indonesia, offers a quieter alternative to Bali, with its serene beaches and slower pace. However, for Surheern, the journey to this island still comes with challenges. Unlike a road trip to Malaysia’s islands, the holiday to Lombok begins at the airport, which lacks the excitement and spontaneity of driving as a family.

The day starts early, with everyone bustling to get their bags ready for the flight. Thanu, excited as ever, eagerly organizes passports and travel itineraries, bouncing with anticipation. Surheern, however, drags their feet, grumbling, “I don’t get why we can’t just drive somewhere.” The drive to the airport is uneventful, and upon arrival, the long lines and crowded terminals sap the energy out of everyone. Surheern slumps in a chair at the gate, earbuds in, mumbling, “This is already too much waiting.”

The flight to Lombok isn’t much better. Although Thanu marvels at the aerial views of Indonesia’s islands, snapping photos and pointing out landmarks, Surheern remains unimpressed. “It’s just clouds and water,” they comment dryly, trying to find a comfortable position in their cramped seat. Turbulence halfway through the flight does little to help their mood, prompting a dramatic “Why didn’t we just stay home?” from Surheern. By the time the family lands, Thanu’s excitement is contagious, but Surheern remains skeptical, muttering, “Let’s see if this place is worth the hassle.”

The drive from Lombok’s airport to the beachside accommodations starts to shift the mood slightly. Unlike the traffic-choked roads of Bali, the journey through Lombok is calm, with scenic views of lush rice fields and quiet villages. Surheern stares out the window, visibly relaxing. “Well, at least there aren’t a million cars here,” they admit grudgingly. Thanu is already planning the next few days, listing activities and pointing out every beautiful view along the way. Surheern, though still wary, occasionally chimes in with a dry joke, like, “That cow by the road has fewer neighbors than me.”

Arriving at the beach, the family is greeted by soft white sands and calm, clear waters. Unlike Bali, the shoreline isn’t crowded, and the peaceful atmosphere immediately soothes Surheern’s frustrations. Thanu races to the water, shouting, “This is perfect!” while Surheern slowly follows, dipping their toes in and remarking, “Okay, this is nice. No one’s stepping on me or my stuff.” The lack of crowds allows the family to spread out and enjoy the beach fully, with Surheern even cracking a rare smile as they dig their feet into the cool sand.

One of the highlights of Lombok is a boat trip to the Gili Islands, just a short ride away. Thanu is thrilled, taking endless photos of the crystal-clear waters, while Surheern relaxes on the boat, enjoying the peaceful ride. The snorkeling is a family favorite, with vibrant coral reefs and colorful fish captivating everyone. Thanu surfaces with wide eyes, exclaiming, “I just swam with a turtle!” Surheern, more reserved, comes up and simply says, “This is actually pretty cool,” before diving back under. The serenity of the experience makes it a standout moment for everyone.

Evenings on Lombok are quiet and reflective. The family enjoys dinners at small beachside cafes, where the sound of waves accompanies every meal. Thanu savors every dish, enthusiastically trying local specialties like ayam taliwang and satay. “This is so good! I’m trying everything!” they exclaim. Surheern, though less vocal, seems to enjoy the meals too, occasionally making sarcastic comments like, “This satay is good enough to almost forgive the flight.”

The island’s tranquil vibe continues with visits to places like Tiu Kelep Waterfall and the rice terraces. While Thanu is eager to trek through the lush paths to the waterfall, Surheern stays at the back of the group, quietly taking in the natural beauty. “It’s peaceful here,” they admit. At the waterfall, Thanu splashes enthusiastically in the cool water, while Surheern dips their hand in and says, “Okay, this is worth it.” The calm, uncrowded atmosphere is a stark contrast to Bali, and it clearly has a soothing effect on everyone, especially Surheern.

The trip ends with a visit to Mount Rinjani’s foothills, where the family marvels at the stunning landscapes and crisp air. Thanu can’t stop taking photos, exclaiming, “This view is incredible!” Surheern stands quietly, gazing at the horizon and commenting, “This is the kind of stuff I like. No noise, no chaos—just this.”

While the journey to Lombok was far from perfect for Surheern, the island’s serenity and lack of crowds make it a more enjoyable experience than Bali. The quiet beaches, peaceful treks, and simple, natural beauty allow even the most skeptical traveler to relax and appreciate the moment. As the family boards the return flight, Thanu is already planning their next trip, while Surheern, calmer now, shrugs and says, “If it’s like Lombok, I guess I wouldn’t mind.” For all its initial frustrations, Lombok managed to turn a reluctant traveler into someone who could finally enjoy the calm it offers.
